## Dimension Reduction and the Fenchel Game

**Abstract:** In this paper, we review the linear dimension reduction algorithm Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as the non-linear reduction algorithms Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps. 

We then examine a novel framework (Fenchel Game No Regret Dynamics) for converting convex function minimization into min-max style games, and apply one such method to a reformulation of PCA. 

This paper also serves as a reference for the theoretical underpinning of such popular dimension reduction algorithms (which is often left as an afterthought), as well as an attempt to clarify and build upon Wang-Abernathy-Levy's paper.
