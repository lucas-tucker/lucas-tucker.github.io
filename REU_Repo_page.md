**Description:** Below you can find the GitHub repository associated with my 2023 REU Paper. In this repository you will find:
- A NumPy implementation of a simple MLP (the MLP is then trained on MNIST up to 85% accuracy)
- Comparison of gradient-descent PCA, baseline PCA, and random projection
- Comparison of standard Laplacian Eigenmaps with ALE and VRLE (as outlined in the paper)

**Note:** This accompanying project allowed me to apply the theory developed in my paper and taught me a bit about PyTorch and Ray.
