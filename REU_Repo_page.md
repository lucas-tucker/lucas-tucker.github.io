**Description:** Below you can find the GitHub repository associated with my 2023 REU Paper. In this repository you will find:
- A NumPy implementation of a simple MLP trained on MNIST up to 85% accuracy
- Comparison of gradient-descent PCA, baseline PCA, and random projection
- Comparison of standard Laplacian Eigenmaps with ALE and VRLE (as defined in the paper)

**Note:** This accompanying project helped introduce me to PyTorch and Ray, and allowed me to apply the theory developed in my paper. Creating a NN from scratch also helped reinforce my gradient calculation skills.
