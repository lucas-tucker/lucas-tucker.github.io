  Hello! I am a junior at the University of Chicago studying mathematics and
  computer science. At the moment I am researching a game theoretic framework
  for dimension reduction algorithms known as Fenchel Game No Regret Dynamics.
  I also enjoy publishing notes on abstruse literature, which you can find below.

  Outside of my research you can find my speaking Japanese, wrestling
  and playing guitar.
