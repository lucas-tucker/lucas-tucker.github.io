  Hello! I am a junior at the University of Chicago studying mathematics &
  computer science, with a passion for algorithmic improvement and machine learning.
  <br><br>
  At the moment I am helping to automate dev platforms at Adobe using GenAI. Outside of my studies you can find me speaking Japanese, wrestling,
  and playing guitar with the Property Damagersâ„¢.
