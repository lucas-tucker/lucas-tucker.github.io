  Hello! I am a junior at the University of Chicago studying mathematics and
  computer science. 
  <br><br>
  At the moment I am researching a game-theoretic framework
  for convex optimization problems known as  
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11309">Fenchel Game No Regret Dynamics</a>.
  I also enjoy publishing notes/solutions to sometimes-abstruse literature, which you can find to
  the right.
  <br><br>
  Outside of my research you can find me speaking Japanese, wrestling,
  and playing guitar.
