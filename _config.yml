  Hello! I am a junior at the University of Chicago studying mathematics &
  computer science. 
  <br><br>
  At the moment I am working on a neat little Chrome extension. I also enjoy publishing notes/solutions to sometimes-abstruse ML literature, which you can find to
  the right.
  <br><br>
  Outside of my research you can find me speaking Japanese, wrestling,
  and playing guitar with the Property Damagersâ„¢.
